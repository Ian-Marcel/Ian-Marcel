## Hi there 👋

- 📚️ I’m currently **learning** on:
  - 🖥️ Virtualization (mainly KVM/QEMU); 
  - 📦️ Containers (mainly Docker);
  - 📜️ Shell-scripts (mainly Bash).
- 🧑‍🏭️ I’m currently **working** on:
  - [Easy-Sourced-NGINX](https://github.com/Ian-Marcel/Easy-Sourced-NGINX): a shell-script writen in bash that helps building Nginx from source by automating a bunch of it process, which is very handy when creating a minimal version for dedicaded services or just adding third-party modules to buff Nginx.
