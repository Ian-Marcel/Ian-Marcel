# 🇧🇷️ Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

I'm Ian, a brazilian programmer who loves to build server side solutions.

## 📚️ I’m currently learning on:
- 🖥️ Virtualization (mainly KVM/Qemu);
- 📦️ Containers (mainly Docker);
- 📜️ Shell-scripts (mainly Bash).

## 👷️ I’m currently working on:
- [Easy-Sourced-NGINX](https://github.com/Ian-Marcel/Easy-Sourced-NGINX): a shell-script written in Bash that make building Nginx from source easy by automating a bunch of it process, which is very handy when creating a minimal version for dedicated services or just adding third-party modules to buff Nginx.
