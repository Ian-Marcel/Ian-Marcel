# 🇧🇷️ Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

I'm Ian, a brazilian programmer who loves building server-side solutions.

## 📚️ I’m currently learning on:
- 🖥️ Virtualization (mainly *KVM/Qemu*);
- 📦️ Containers (mainly *Docker*);
- 📜️ Shell-scripts (mainly in *Bash*).

## 👷️ I’m currently working on:
- [Easy-Sourced-NGINX](https://github.com/Ian-Marcel/Easy-Sourced-NGINX): a shell-script written in *Bash* that make building *Nginx* from source easier by automating a bunch of it process, which is very handy when creating a minimal *Nginx* for dedicated services or just adding third-party modules to enrich your favorite web server.
